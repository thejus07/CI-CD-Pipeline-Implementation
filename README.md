This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, aimed at accelerating software delivery and improving deployment reliability.

By integrating build, test, and deployment stages into a seamless Jenkins pipeline, the project achieves:

⚡ 60% faster deployment cycles

✅ Minimized human errors through automation

🔁 Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery best practices

The pipeline is defined as code (Jenkinsfile) and supports modular extension to various environments (e.g., AWS EC2, Docker containers, on-prem servers). Unit tests are triggered automatically, and deployment scripts ensure consistent delivery across stages.
